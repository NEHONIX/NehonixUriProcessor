## Code of Conduct

Our project adheres to a Code of Conduct that sets expectations for participation in our community. We expect all contributors to read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NEHONIX/NehonixUriProcessor/tree/features/nehonix-security-booster
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
4. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/nehonix/nehonixUriProcessor.git
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-you-are-fixing
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you did"
   ```

3. Keep your branch updated with the main branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

4. Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

5. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to our main repository.
2. Ensure your PR has a clear title and description that explains the changes and their purpose.
3. Link any relevant issues in your PR description using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Resolves #456".
4. Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers who may request changes or clarification.
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR into the main branch.
